            <h2>The Vosfor Printer</h2>
            <p>
                Void Cascade is a thrilling and immersive game mode that challenges players to navigate the depths of a mysterious, ever-shifting realm. Set in a dystopian landscape where reality is fractured, players must utilize their skills and strategy to survive the chaos of the void. With unique mechanics and unpredictable environmental changes, each session offers a fresh and exhilarating experience that keeps players on their toes.
            </br>
                Teamwork and adaptability are paramount. Players must collaborate to harness powerful artifacts scattered throughout the map, each granting unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle. The dynamic gameplay encourages creative strategies, as players face both AI-controlled adversaries and rival teams. As the void expands and contracts, players must make quick decisions to secure their positions, utilize their surroundings, and ultimately emerge victorious in a race against time and the elements.

                    <h3>Priorities</h3>

                <h4>Exolizers</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Cascade meter is a set of scales that tips in either direction depending on how many Exolizers are currently possessed or purged. The more possessed Exolizers there are, the faster the meter will fill. A full meter means mission over. Whatever chaos you find yourself in, consider 4+ possessed Exolizers an emergency that requires immediate attention, as the meter fills incredibly fast at this point.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Thrax Killing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Thrax drop Arcanes, so you want them dead. They are also dangerous elite units in their own right, with Overguard, magnetic procs, and leaping/floating attacks that make them untargetable. They're here to give you a hard time and possess Exolizers, so you don't want their numbers to spiral out of control. Keep on top of them.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Trash Killing</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are times where clearing trash mobs will be your priority. Maybe they're crowding an Exolizer and you need them gone to make it safe for your Operator, maybe you desperately need energy orbs, or maybe you're getting kills within an Exolizer's golden circle to brute force the meter down. However, being a corridor warrior who gets distracted is a leading cause of runs spiralling out of control. Stay with the objective.

                    <h3>Teams and Roles</h3>

                    <h4>Dedicated Attacker</h4>

                    <p>
                        This player must focus on the Exolizer Rotation, leaving a purged room ASAP and waiting for new Exolizer spawns in the next room. The speed of the run is dictated by how quickly they purge Exolizers and start the timers. They need to kill the Thrax Centurions that purged Exolizers spit out, so they want strong single-target weaponry in their loadout, and a strong Operator.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Flex Attacker</h4>
                    <p>
                        This player wants to focus on making their way to new Exolizers as a priority, but they get a little more freedom to hold back in the defence room if the Defenders need to catch up. Since they know the Dedicated Attacker is focused on killing Thrax, they can focus on trash killing to keep enemies off the Dedicated Attacker while they focus on Exolizers, but typically if extra Thrax spawn to re-possess Exolizers in the attack room, this player is expected to deal with with it so the Dedicated Attacker is not distracted.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Dedicated Defender</h4>
                    <p>
                        This player must focus on the defence room and not leave too early. They may want to draw trash units into the golden Exolizer circles to brute force the meter down and create breathing room for the Attackers. They want to spot a Thrax coming, and kill it before it possesses an Exolizer, so the Exolizer Rotation remains intact and timers complete as quickly as possible (poor defending will slow down a run just as much as slow attacking). They want strong single-target weaponry in their loadout, and a strong Operator.

                    <p>
                        A Thrax's Overguard overtakes their health as they scale. At level cap their total health pool consists of ~9.5 million health and ~15.5 million Overguard. Magnetic priming is therefore recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thrax have a weakness to Void damage, and have no resistances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to their Overguard, Thrax cannot be traditionally crowd controlled, but up to 4 Cold procs can be applied to slow them down for easier headshots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If Thrax's attack abilities are causing you trouble, you can prevent them from using them with Silence.

                    <figure></figure>
                        <img src="thraxghost.webp" class="smallimg">

                            <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Thrax_Centurion">Thrax Ghost</a>

                    <p>
                        Headshots will greatly improve your Amp damage. After a Thrax completes its spinning Spectral animation, it will always be facing in the same direction as its Physical form "died" - use the animation to prepare and position yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a Spectral form gets away from you before you manage to kill it, it will become extra vulnerable to damage while it tries to absorb a nearby unit to regenerate itself (colloquially known as The Slurpee). Use this short window as an opportunity to finish the job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Madurai: while the Thrax performs its Spectral animation, do a Void Sling, then cast Contamination Wave three times. This primes the Thrax to take more Void damage, procs Eradicate, and depletes your energy enough to proc Onslaught.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Madurai: Void Strike has a long cooldown, and you will often be expected to deal with Spectrals when it's not available. Get used to the Contamination Wave method above as your bread and butter, and only use Void Strike as and when needed.

                    <h3>Recommended Weapons</h3>

                    <h4>Laetum + Xata's Whisper</h4>
                    <p>
                        Although the double-dipping from the Devouring Attrition evolution has been removed, Laetum has a great damage output on its own, and Xata's Whisper, being Void damage, is still a great subsume vs Void-vulnerable Thrax. This also remains an accessible option for newer players, due to the time-gated access of other Incarnon Genesis weapons in the Duviri Circuit.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Dual Toxocysts</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dual Toxocyst has a great damage output, both for single target and trash clearing. It works well modded for Corrosive alongside two Corrosive Emerald Shards for armour strip, and is often paired with a Nourish subsume for Viral. Scourge is often used with it for easier headshots.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Furis</h4>
                    <p>
                        Furis likewise has a great damage output, and very quickly stacks an immense amount of Heat DoTs. Roar is a good subsume for double dipping these DoTs. Scourge can help with easier headshots.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Heavy Slam</h4>
                    <p>
                        Melee Crescendo and/or Tennokai make this method much easier to use and maintain than in the past. Wrathful Advance as a subsume can help, but is not required. Finishers for Crescendo can be easily stacked through Aero mods, Dizzying Rounds on Bronco, and Mercy kills on Eximus and heavy units.
