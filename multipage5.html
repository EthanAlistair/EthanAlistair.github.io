            <h2>Top Strategies Before Steel Path</h2>
            <p>
                Aya is considered the prime destination for farming relics and trading for platinum, offering Warframe players a lucrative opportunity with minimal effort. In this comprehensive guide, we'll unveil the secrets to maximize your gains and ensure a steady stream of platinum income. 
            </br>
                This game mode emphasizes efficiency and strategy, requiring players to assess the best bounties to reroll based on their needs and objectives. The reroll mechanic introduces an element of chance and choice, as players can decide whether to cash in on a decent reward or push their luck for something more valuable. With each successful completion, players inch closer to obtaining the rare items that can significantly enhance their gameplay experience.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Before diving into the guide, please note that this strategy is time-sensitive, depending on the availability of specific bounties. We use a unique technique to achieve the highest farming efficiency. You might wonder why we avoid Deimos or Orb Vallis bounties; it's because the stages in those areas are less efficient than those in the Plains of Eidolon. Other methods simply aren't worth the time investment. Remember, you can always focus on other aspects of the game, not just Aya farming.

                    <p>
                        Aya farming is not a new thing within Warframe but it has developed throughout the years. There are many ways to farm aya, which are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Opening Relic Packs</li>
                        <li>Missions</li>
                        <li>Open World Bounties</li>
                        <li>Rerolling Bounties</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Syndicates and Open World vendors could be used for daily hand-ins for extra packs. But you can grind nothing since you have a limit. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Missions are not optimal either since the drop chance of Aya is too low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are now left with two choices: bounties and rerolling a bounty. Doing bounties could yield some profit, but the problem is the vast amount of time it will take to complete the bounties. Even if Aya's drop chance is good in the end, it won't be profitable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leaving the best for last, bounty rerolling. It means we will reroll a certain bounty (Queing up a certain bounty) until we get the desired stages (which you will get to know later in the guide). The idea behind it is that you get super easy-to-do and fast stages so that completing the entire bounty won't take more than 2 minutes for the average player.

                        Volt's Speed ability significantly boosts movement speed for both Volt and nearby allies. This allows you to cover large distances quickly, which is crucial for completing objectives in bounties that often require moving across vast open-world areas
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When using Volt to speedrun bounties for Aya, focusing on maximizing Ability Strength is especially beneficial because it boosts Volt's Speed ability, which not only increases your own movement speed but also affects the speed of objectives like mobile defense drones in the bounty missions. Here's why maximizing Ability Strength with Volt is advantageous:
                    </p>

                    <h4>Shedu and Akarius</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shedu has a slightly smaller base AOE damage radius than the others. Although you can equip a mod to increase Shedu's base AOE damage radius, it doesn't actually increase it. In contrast, mods for Kuva Tonkor and Akarius significantly increase their AOE damage radius.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Akarius is the most optimal for time and rewards due to its larger AOE damage radius and ability to kill with one trigger pull, provided you don't miss due to enemy movement or distance. In situations where precise aiming is difficult, Shedu is more optimal since it can kill enemies without needing to move closer. This is especially true for killing Grineer enemies on Tusk Bolkor or Tusk Firbolg. Even though Akarius has homing projectiles, you can still miss them if your aim isn't perfect.

                    <h3>Supports</h3>

                    <h4>Duration Volt</h4>
                    <p>
                        Your main role is to make sure everyone has your second ability at all times in order to fly around faster. The best time to do so is before the bounty starts, whenever you finish the rescue target stage as well since everyone will be close to each other in the circle. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do not speed the drone, as this will overwrite the strength volt duration and cause it to overshoot its target. You can buff the drone, but only if the nova in your squad (if you have one) agrees to it because giving the drone speed can make it very difficult for the nova to place teleports.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Nidus</h4>
                    <p>
                        As a Nidus your main job and role is to link to the strength volt for the drone phase, make sure to immediately rush to the drone spot as fast as you possible can, then you will dash to proc madurai “Sling Strength” which will give you 40% extra power strength for your link, then you use empower ability, then you proc the arcane called “Molt Vigor” and lastly you link to volt. This should give volt around 120% link strength. Your second role is basically to help with bounty.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Nova</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you choose nova, good luck, you need to be comfortable with using teleport because it is your most important alone. You alone can speed up the bounty time to an average of 1m30s but only if you are good with your teleports. It is also up to you whether you decide if you want the drone to be getting speed buff or not since you are the one who is gonna teleport the drone. Your second role is basically to help with bounty.
