            <h2>Post Steel Path Platinum Farming Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                As players progress through Warframe and reach the Steel Path, new opportunities for farming Platinum emerge. The endgame introduces various high-value farming strategies that capitalize on the unique resources and enemies available in this phase of the game. 
            </br>
                This section will explore three of the most effective methods for earning Platinum after reaching Steel Path: Steel Path Acolyte farming, Kuva Lich and Sisters of Parvos weapon trading, and Radshare relic farming. Each of these strategies offers players the chance to maximize their Platinum income while enjoying the thrill of high-level gameplay.

                    <h3>Acolyte Farming</h3>

                    <p>
                        Steel Path Acolyte farming is a top-tier strategy for earning Platinum and valuable resources in Warframe's endgame. Acolytes are unique mini-bosses that spawn exclusively in Steel Path missions, dropping powerful Primary and Secondary Arcanes, along with Steel Essence, which can be exchanged for valuable items at Teshin's shop. These Arcanes are essential for maximizing weapon performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to Arcanes, Acolytes also drop Steel Essence, a valuable currency in the Steel Path. Steel Essence can be traded at Teshin's shop for a variety of high-value items, including Umbra Forma, Rivens, Kuva, and exclusive cosmetics. A particularly profitable strategy is to accumulate Steel Essence and wait for Teshin's shop rotation to feature high-demand items like Umbra Forma, which can be sold for a significant amount of Platinum due to their rarity and importance in high-end builds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using resource boosters and drop chance boosters can further enhance farming by increasing the amount of Steel Essence and improving the drop rates of rare Arcanes. Overall, Steel Path Acolyte farming is a lucrative strategy for earning Platinum and acquiring essential endgame resources, making it a must for players looking to enhance their gear and profit in the Warframe economy.

                    <h3>Kuva Lich and Sister of Parvos</h3>

                    <figure></figure>
                        <img src="kuvaogris.webp" class="smallimg">

                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Farming Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos offers a unique opportunity to earn Platinum through the acquisition and trading of their exclusive weapons. Kuva and Tenet weapons are some of the most powerful in the game, featuring enhanced stats and unique abilities that make them highly desirable to players. Each weapon has various elemental bonuses and ranks that can increase its value significantly, especially if they have high percentages of popular elements like Heat or Toxin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process begins by hunting down a Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos, completing the necessary missions to unveil their Requiem sequence, and eventually defeating them in a showdown. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once defeated, you have the option to convert the Lich/Sister into an ally or vanquish them, keeping their weapon for yourself. You can trade converted Liches/Sisters with other players, allowing them to skip the hunt and acquire the weapon directly. High-stat weapons, especially those with desirable elemental bonuses, can be sold for significant amounts of Platinum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maximizing profits involves hunting for the most popular and powerful weapons, such as the Kuva Zarr, Kuva Bramma, Tenet Cycron, and Tenet Detron. Rolling high elemental percentages requires a bit of luck, but the more you hunt, the better your chances of obtaining valuable trades. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, you can farm Requiem Relics and Mods during these hunts, which are also marketable commodities. Regular trading of Liches/Sisters with top-tier weapons can lead to a steady stream of Platinum, making this an excellent endgame farming strategy.

                    <h3>Radiant Relic Sharing</h3>

                    <figure></figure>
                        <img src="axiradiant.webp" class="smallimg">

                            <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Relic">Rad Axi Relic</a>

                    <p>
                        Radshares, short for "Radiant Relic Shares," are a popular farming method among Warframe veterans for obtaining rare Prime parts and sets that can be sold for high Platinum prices. This method involves refining Relics to their Radiant quality, which maximizes the chance of obtaining rare items, and then running Void Fissure missions in a coordinated squad where all members bring the same Radiant Relic. This increases the chances of getting rare and valuable drops like Warframe parts, weapons, or other high-demand items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The key to Radshare farming is coordination and communication with your squad. Players typically use recruiting channels or join dedicated Warframe communities to organize Radshare groups, ensuring that everyone is contributing Radiant versions of the same Relic. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Running in a four-player squad maximizes the number of chances per mission to obtain the desired rare item, significantly boosting efficiency compared to solo farming. Popular missions for Radshare farming include Capture or Exterminate missions, as they are fast and straightforward, allowing you to complete runs quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you acquire rare parts or complete sets from Radshare runs, you can sell them directly on trading platforms or in the in-game trade chat. Rare parts, especially those from recently released or vaulted Prime Warframes and weapons, can fetch very high prices. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Staying updated on which Prime items are in demand will help you target the most profitable Relics for Radshare farming. This method not only provides a fun, team-oriented way to farm but also serves as a reliable source of Platinum in the endgame, making it a favored choice for veteran players.
