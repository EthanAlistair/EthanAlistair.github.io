            <h2>Top Strategies Before Steel Path</h2>
            <p>
                Earning Platinum is a key aspect of progressing in Warframe, especially for players who are just starting out and haven't reached Steel Path yet. Platinum allows you to buy Warframes, weapons, mods, and other valuable resources that can significantly enhance your gameplay experience. While there are many ways to farm Platinum, some methods are particularly accessible and effective for early-game players. 
            </br>
                This guide will cover three of the most efficient Platinum farming strategies available before reaching Steel Path: farming Prime Junk, farming Corrupted Mods in Deimos, and acquiring Syndicate Augment Mods. Mastering these methods will help you build a solid Platinum reserve and accelerate your progress in the game.

                    <h3>Prime Junk</h3>

                        Farming Prime Junk is a popular and reliable method for earning Platinum in Warframe, especially for early-game players. "Prime Junk" refers to common or duplicate Prime parts that aren't highly valuable individually but can still be sold to other players or traded for Ducats at the Void Trader (Baro Ki'Teer). Despite being labeled as "junk," these items can add up quickly in value and are often in demand by players who need them for Ducats or to complete sets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process of farming Prime Junk revolves around running Void Fissure missions with Relics. Lith, Meso, and Neo Relics are the easiest to acquire and open for newer players, and they often contain parts considered "junk" due to their abundance. Capture and Exterminate missions are the quickest for opening Relics because they are fast and straightforward, allowing you to maximize the number of Relics you can open in a short time. Farming in a full squad also helps, as it provides more options to choose from when picking Prime parts, increasing your chances of getting duplicate parts that you can later sell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you've accumulated enough Prime Junk, you can either sell the parts directly to other players for Platinum (usually in bulk sales) or exchange them for Ducats at Baro Ki'Teer's relay station when he appears every two weeks. Selling parts in bulk to other players is a quick way to make Platinum, especially if you're willing to sell at a slightly lower rate to move inventory fast. Many players prefer to buy Prime parts in bulk to save time farming, making this a viable market niche for early-game players. Over time, this strategy can yield significant Platinum, especially when combined with efficient farming techniques and keeping an eye on which parts are currently in demand.

                    <h3>Corrupted Mods</h3>

                    <figure></figure>

                    <p>
                        Farming Corrupted Mods in the Orokin Vaults on Deimos is a highly profitable Platinum-earning strategy for early-game players. Corrupted Mods are unique mods that offer both a powerful bonus and a drawback, making them a staple in many advanced builds. Because of their strong utility, Corrupted Mods such as "Fleeting Expertise," "Blind Rage," and "Overextended" are always in high demand among players, often fetching substantial amounts of Platinum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process of farming Corrupted Mods involves running missions in the Orokin Derelict, specifically Capture, Exterminate, or Survival missions. Each mission contains a hidden Orokin Vault that requires one of four Dragon Keys (Bleeding, Decaying, Extinguished, and Hobbled) to open. These keys come with penalties that debuff your Warframe, so it's often best to run these missions with a squad where each member brings a different key. This team-based approach ensures that you can open the Vault no matter which key is required, streamlining the farming process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you've gathered a collection of Corrupted Mods, you can sell them to other players via trade chat or platforms like Warframe Market. Pricing can vary, but rare and meta-relevant mods, like "Narrow Minded" and "Transient Fortitude," are consistently valuable. The ability to run these missions repeatedly and the relatively high drop rate of Corrupted Mods make this a reliable source of early Platinum. For new players, learning how to navigate the Vaults and efficiently manage Dragon Keys is a great way to start building a solid Platinum reserve.

                    <h3>Augment Mods</h3>

                    <figure></figure>
                        <img src="syndicate.webp" class="smallimg">

                    <p>
                        Syndicate Augment Mods are another excellent source of Platinum for early-game players. Each Syndicate offers unique augment mods that enhance specific Warframe abilities, often making them far more powerful or efficient. These augment mods are highly sought after by players looking to optimize their Warframes for specific playstyles, making them a valuable commodity in the Warframe economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To start farming Syndicate Augment Mods, you'll need to join one of the six main Syndicates. As you complete missions and earn standing with your chosen Syndicate, you can spend that standing to purchase augment mods, which can then be sold to other players for Platinum. Syndicates also offer daily missions that award additional standing, helping you accumulate it faster. Early-game players can start earning Syndicate standing once they reach Mastery Rank 3, making this a viable strategy soon after beginning the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The key to making this method profitable is identifying which augment mods are currently in demand. Keeping an eye on the meta and understanding which Warframes are popular can help you decide which augments to focus on. Selling these mods directly through trade chat or Warframe Market allows you to quickly turn your earned standing into Platinum, offering a steady and scalable income source. This strategy can be particularly lucrative when combined with other forms of farming, such as gathering resources or running missions that also contribute to your Syndicate standing.
